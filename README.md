# Welcome to Mortar!

Mortar is a platform-as-a-service for Hadoop.  With Mortar, you can run jobs on Hadoop using Apache Pig and Python without any special training.  You create your project using the Mortar command-line tool, deploy code using the Git revision control system, and Mortar does the rest.

# Million Song Project

This is an example Mortar project using the publicly-available [Million Song Dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/field-list).  

It has two pigscripts that you can use and customize:

* `top_density_songs`: Find the songs with the most beats per second in the 1MM song dataset.  Code to ***REALLY FAST*** music.
* `hottest_song_of_the_decade`: Figure out which song was the hottest in every decade

If  you add more interesting pigscripts, please send us a pull request!
